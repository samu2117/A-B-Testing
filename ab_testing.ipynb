    "# Final Project Instructions\n",
    "## Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\n",

    "## Metric Choice\n",
    "Which of the following metrics would you choose to measure for this experiment and why? For each metric you choose, indicate whether you would use it as an invariant metric or an evaluation metric. The practical significance boundary for each metric, that is, the difference that would have to be observed before that was a meaningful change for the business, is given in parentheses. All practical significance boundaries are given as absolute changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Any place \"unique cookies\" are mentioned, the uniqueness is determined by day. (That is, the same cookie visiting on different days would be counted twice.) User-ids are automatically unique since the site does not allow the same user-id to enroll twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of cookies: That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=3000)\n",
    "* Number of user-ids: That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. (dmin=50)\n",
    "* Number of clicks: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button (which happens before the free trial screener is trigger). (dmin=240)\n",
    "* Click-through-probability: That is, number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. (dmin=0.01)\n",
    "* Gross conversion: That is, number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. (dmin= 0.01)\n",
    "* Retention: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. (dmin=0.01)\n",
    "* Net conversion: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. (dmin= 0.0075)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also decide now what results you will be looking for in order to launch the experiment. Would a change in any one of your evaluation metrics be sufficient? Would you want to see multiple metrics all move or not move at the same time in order to launch? This decision will inform your choices while designing the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invariant metrics: The following variables marked as invariant and should not change across groups in the experiment. \n",
    "* Number of cookies: This is the unit of diversion, since the user_id is greater than a cookie and the user_id is not stored for the users that are not enrolled to courses. Cookies will be randomly assigned to control or experiment group and both groups should have roughly the same amount number of cookies.\n",
    "* Number of clicks: The number of clicks to the \"Start free trial\" button should also remain constant since the behavior of the button should not change in the experiment, since it is located before the changes we want to measure.\n",
    "* Click-through-probability: The probability that a user clicks the \"Start free trial\" button should be the same in two groups for the same reason that the number of clicks should remain similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation metrics: Metrics that will be used to assess changes across the control and experiment groups. The metrics that should be chosen for evaluation are the ones that are expected to have an impact in the experiment group.\n",
    "* Gross conversion: The total number of users that enroll in the free trial should be reduced since the message that is being shown in the experiment group should make less dedicated students to retract the enrolling decision in some cases. The total number is being normalized by the number of cookies that click the \"Free trial\" button\n",
    "* Retention: The users that keep enrolled after the 14 day trial divided by the total number of users that started the free trial es expected to increase since it is expected that the more dedicated users are the ones that actually use the free trial.\n",
    "* Net conversion: The net conversion, that is the number of users (ids) that remain enrolled and make a payment may be increase since we are expecting more dedicated users to be enrolled in the course, those users have more probability to keep being enrolled after the free trial. This metric is more likely to increase if the retention increases since the probability of enrollment further the 14 trial is even higher .Again this metric is being normalized by the number of cookies that click the \"Free trial\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of user-ids:\n",
    "* This variable will not be used in this experiment as there is no expectancy of this metric to be constant across experiments and it does not give us enough information as out other metrics have to be an evaluation metric.\n",
